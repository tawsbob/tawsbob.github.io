                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    
                    <p>I am Dellean Santos, a Brazilian-born professional born in 1990, with a passion for technology and a proven track record in the software development industry. My journey began at the age of 14 when I delved into programming, setting the stage for a fulfilling career in the field.</p>
                    <p>After obtaining my degree in Graphic Design in 2011, I embarked on a career in web development. My expertise grew from frontend development in 2009 to backend development in 2012, and I embraced Node.js from its early stages. In 2015, I joined the Brazilian startup Winnin as a Software Engineer, where I eventually led a team of developers that expanded from 3 to 60 members, with 15 reporting directly to me.</p>
                    <p>My proficiency extends to React.js, and I am well-versed in Scrum, Kanban, and Agile methodologies since 2012. Venturing into DevOps using AWS from 2015, I possess skills in both SQL and NoSQL databases. As a full-stack developer, I specialize in frontend development, and my experience includes UX/UI design.</p>
                    <p>Known for my friendly demeanor and a genuine passion for helping others, I am dedicated to continuous learning and teaching. In addition to contributing to various projects, I have developed my own Software as a Service (SaaS). Currently, I hold the position of Technical Leader at Prudential, one of the largest life insurance companies in the United States.</p>
                    <p>With a GitHub account created in 2014, I bring a wealth of experience in unit testing, end-to-end testing, and a deep commitment to quality and innovation. I am excited about the prospect of contributing my skills and leadership to a dynamic team and driving success in your organization.</p>
                    <p>Thank you for considering my application.</p>

                    <p>I was shot 5 times and survived, I recovered from a situation that no one was able to help me. While most are complaining about obvious things, I am grateful for every second.</p>
                    
                    <p>
